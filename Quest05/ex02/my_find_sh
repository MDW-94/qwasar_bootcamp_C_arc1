Write a command line that searches for all file names that end with ".sh" (without quotation marks) in the current directory and all its sub-directories. It should display only the name of files without the extension .sh.

Tips
You should dig into the command find (man find) specially the -exec option
You should dig into the command basename
You should dig into the command rev (man rev)
You should dig into the command cut (man cut)
You should dig into the command sed (man sed)



     -exec utility [argument ...] ;
             True if the program named utility returns a zero value as its
             exit status.  Optional arguments may be passed to the utility.
             The expression must be terminated by a semicolon (“;”).  If you
             invoke find from a shell you may need to quote the semicolon if
             the shell would otherwise treat it as a control operator.  If the
             string “{}” appears anywhere in the utility name or the arguments
             it is replaced by the pathname of the current file.  Utility will
             be executed from the directory from which find was executed.
             Utility and arguments are not subject to the further expansion of
             shell patterns and constructs.

     -exec utility [argument ...] {} +
             Same as -exec, except that “{}” is replaced with as many
             pathnames as possible for each invocation of utility.  This
             behaviour is similar to that of xargs(1).  The primary always
             returns true; if at least one invocation of utility returns a
             non-zero exit status, find will return a non-zero exit status.
