# Qwasar - C Bootcamp // Arc01

C assignments going through Linux Programmer's Manual functions and other coding projects to become more familiar with C.

Directories are broken down into the different sections of the Quests (sections) of the Arc.

## Installation & Setup

Most of these projects can be run locally using the compiled C file or performing a git pull request into a directory.

Once directory has been pulled:

```bash
gcc filename.c -o compiled_filename && compiled_filename
```

This command will compile, name the compilations and run the compilation all at once.

#### Linux Programmer's Manual functions

Most assignments will include a test() function where my interpretation of the Linux Programmer's Manual function will be tested alongside the standard function (included in the <string.h> library).
